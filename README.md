# m2-list
This is a small todo-list application. It is built by electron. 
I build this from **electron-quick-start** repo, and use a lot of code in that repo.
# idea of this application
When you start to work, there are so many things appear in your mind. So you can just write them down and continue your work. After that, you have a list, and this application will give you list item randomly. Then you choose to do it or just get another item.
# command available
* `add something-to-do`: this will add something to the whole list.
* `list`: this will list all the things your list.
* `clear`: clear all the things that appears in your list.
* `get`: get a random item from your list, and then you can start to do it.
* `done`: this will mark the item you *get* before done, and remove that item from your list.
* `save`: save current list. And you can close this application.
* `restore`: restore list if you saved list before.
# how to build
* first, you can clone this repo.
* Then, you enter that directory, and run "yarn".
* Then, you run "yarn build" to get distribute version.
* Or you can run "yarn start" to run directly.
