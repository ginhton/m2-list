<h3 align="center">m2-list</h3>
<p align="center">It is a small todo-list application.</p>
</p>

## Idea
  When I start to work, there are so many things appearing in my mind. I just write them down and continue my work. After doing that, I have a list. And this application helps me record such things and give me one randomly to do. Then I choose to do it or just get another list item.
